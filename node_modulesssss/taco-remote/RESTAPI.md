# REST API
Refer to test/selftest.js for a working example of how a client interacts with the server from build submission all the way through to downloading and deleting a completed build.
The following URL's assume server is running on localhost port 3000, mounted in remotebuild at path mountLocation

## POST http://localhost:3000/mountLocation/build/tasks?vcordova=&lt;cordova_version_of_app&gt;&cfg=&lt;build_configuration&gt;&command=&lt;build_command>

Submits a new build task. Request data is the Cordova app to be built, archived and compressed in .tgz format.

Request parameters:

* command - the build command to execute. Currently, only build is supported. Will support emulate later.
* vcordova - the version of cordova the app is based on. If this is incompatible with the server's version the build will be rejected.
* cfg - the build configuration, debug|release

Response is JSON format with build information including the unique 'buildNumber' of the build
